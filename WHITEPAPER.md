## Inception

Everything acts as some kind of prop or craft (propcraft). Propcrafts exist forever in NFT(Non-Fungible Token). CryptoCar is just one concrete application type of propcraft.

Current market still lacks of excellent NFT standards which support propcrafts to seamlessly traverse/trek through different applicaitons, games or virtual horizons, such as game items, characters/avatars, props and AI crafts.

CryptoCar project is trying to create and establish such NFT token standards and implement them on top of Miraland blockchain technology.

## Mission

Construct a DAO community dedicated to CryptoCar NFTs crossing beyond horizons of multiple games, applications and automotive brands.

Develop and cultivate CryptoCar ecosystem, from CryptoCar NFT minting, presentation, air drop, earn, exchange, transaction as well as circulation.

Enable CryptoCars flexible to have their own abilities, components as well as attributes. Components themselves may also be NFTs, and can be mounted/unmounted to/from other propcrafts, becoming a part or sub component of others. 

Support evolutive CryptoCars. The abilities, attributes or components of cryptocars can change as time goes by, that is, cryptocars tend to evolve over time. 

Construct community-driven CryptoCar evolution protocol, design proof of evolution(PoE) by which all community members/car owners will be rewarded and recognized with native/sub-native tokens or unique and specialized NFT. The common approaches to obtain tokens and NFTs include air drop as well as multiple social interactions like sign up, sign in, check in, post, comment, forward, etc. Meanwhile, Play-to-Earn is another important way to obtain and evolve CryptoCarsâ€™ performance.

## Design Principles

*TODO*


## Tokens

There are three(3) token categories:  native fungible tokens(MLN), derived ERC20 like tokens(Points, etc) as well as non-fungible tokens(CryptoCar NFT and others) which are all users' virtual assets carrying value.

## Features

*Coming soon*
