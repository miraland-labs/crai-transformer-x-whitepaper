The old era is leaving, and civilization has entered the era of web3.0 and AI. AI has greatly increased productivity, and web3.0 naturally provides the accompanying production relationship for this revolutionary productivity, which is also the basis of web3.0's argument: crypto-rized decentralization. From web3.0 to AI, product iterations have gradually accelerated, and the new economic model of combining Ai and Crypto has swept the world. Virtual digital assets are bound to bring a breeze of fresh air to the automotive industry that is rolling towards the extreme, opening up a whole new space of value. To more concisely express this combination of revolutionary productivity and innovative production relations, we have defined a brand new term: Crai, which stands for the deep integration or fusion of Crypto and Ai.

The idea of the sovereign individual is quietly approaching and is being familiarized, recognized and accepted by the younger generation. The introduction of various data security and privacy protection-related bills in many countries around the world is just an introduction and bootstrap to the trend of the sovereign individual era. Crai has pushed the traditional industry to unprecedented heights, even rolled to suffocating. The car, now as the first form of existence of intelligent species or rather robots, is the host of highly integrated and concentrated cutting-edge technology; and the TranformerX (whether Humankind or Autobot) naturally becomes the ideal carrier for developing and practicing the concept of sovereign individual.

## Data Sovereignty

Like waves of night and storm, Crai's momentum is unstoppable. There was a time when data was silently driving and reshaping value creation across all industries. Data has deservedly become a real means and material of production, and users have long been involved in contributing to the enterprise or industry value chain as a real core element, and unknowingly users have taken up the banner of being the creator of enterprise product value and the shaper of industry brands.

In the auto industry, which has been rolled and choked by the spring river, the arrival of Crai has been appreciated early by automotive people. There are three broad categories of automotive industry data at a glance: manufacturing data (SCM/ERM/MES), driving big data (IoT/ICN data, smart driving data, map navigation and interaction data), and marketing big data (CRM/CEM/SRM/DMS and other user experience and word-of-mouth communication data, etc.). As far as sovereign individuals are concerned, driving big data and marketing big data are closely concerned and are important targets involved in various user data protection today. User data protection is divided into two parts: data privacy and data security. Data privacy focuses on the collection, use, release, and dissemination of user data; data security emphasizes the prevention of unauthorized access to sovereign individuals' data, the prevention of data leakage, and related countermeasures, etc.

It is worth pointing out that the future smart/intelligent car itself can even become a "sovereign individual", even at the moment, the data generated by smart driving should actually be owned by the owner in the legal sense, not the vehicle manufacturer.

## Value Metrics
Since data creates value, it is important to measure the value it contains. This is still a relatively new area of research, and there are still no mature standards for measuring the value of data, but the establishment of multiple data exchanges should play a positive role in promoting this.
As far as the automotive industry is concerned, the simplest and fair and equal way to measure the big data of driving is to use mileage as the benchmark, which is equally applicable to traditional oil cars and new energy vehicles, and the logic behind it is also simple and "brutal": no matter the fossil energy or clean energy consumed, it is eventually transformed into the mileage of the vehicle, and the amount of data generated in the process is also positively correlated. The amount of data generated in the process is also positively correlated. Of course, the value of data can also be measured in terms of its size (KB, MB, GB, etc.) after it is standardized, similar to how much a truckload of sand is sold for in a mine.
The value of marketing big data can be quantified from 2 perspectives, experience and communication, to measure.

## Value Quantification

After the value is quantified, it is necessary to execute the confirmation of the quantified value, i.e., to award the sovereign individual to recognize his contribution. the infrastructure of the confirmation of the right in the Crai era is the blockchain, and the general-purpose public chain or vertical community chain is the base implementation for matching. The general form of corroboration is to award or reward native token, derivative token or NFT to sovereign individuals.

## The Crai Transformer X Project

The birth of automobiles, especially the current smart species represented by smart cars, is a battlefield that can focus on the various firepower of the Crai frontier. Whether it is the sovereign ownership of the data generated by smart driving and smart interaction or the sovereign ownership of its derived values and even various rights and interests, all are cohesive and rooted in Crai. Crai transforms everything! This is how our Crai Transformer X (digital asset) project was born.

The **Crai Transformer X(CATX)** project consists of two core components: an AI-enabled user autonomous value community (Qing Tong Horizon) and a Crypto-driven decentralized underlying infrastructure, the Miraland blockchain, which is community oriented. The former focuses on user interaction and user experience, while the latter focuses on providing fair and equal trust and value support.

## Qing Tong Horizon (QTH)

As a sovereign individual, any individual, corporate or AI intelligence can choose to join Qing Tong Horizon as a member, members are commonly referred to as Qthor(s). The core concept and spirit of Qing Tong Horizon emphasizes user autonomy, user consensus and user value. QTH consists of multiple tribes oriented by industry themes or interests. Corporate members include, but are not limited to, the following types or forms of eco-partners: auto brands or manufacturers, dealers, pop-up shops, repair stations, auto insurance, auto finance, auto leasing, auto decoration and beauty, used car agencies, travels and hotels, food and beverage brands, etc.

**Community Vision: Crafting The Most Trustless Value Community In Crai Era**

QTH plans to introduce three categories of digital assets for airdrop, reward, award, or grant to community members:
1. **Community native digital tokens** that can be used for governance voting in co-creation communities, carrying community consensus and value, or used for co-creation crowdfunding-related "virtual equity" exploration, etc.

2. **Community-derived digital tokens** that represent the credit or value that users earn, accumulate, and use to exchange for products or services on a daily basis, and can of course be used to map the community's "virtual equity";

3. **Community Digital Collections (NFT)**, a privilege and credential that can prove the user's identity and allow the user to participate in an activity or event, as well as one of the carriers of the user's collection or storage value.

Community digital assets include but are not limited to: points, badges, game props, community rewards, user avatars, virtual cars, other digital rights and interests (such as vouchers) and even virtual shares worth trying and exploring (depending on the degree of legal and regulatory permission).

The virtual car NFT that the Crai Transformer X project tries to launch is evolvable[1], and the growth of the virtual car depends on user behavior, data voluntarily or actively contributed by members or vehicle data.

The community encourages user innovation and co-creation, and performs metrics on user innovation and contribution in the form of digital assets through community consensus, and confirms rights, and users are free to dispose of data and virtual digital assets belonging to themselves.

Members of the community can issue their own Credit Tokens or NFTs to give or provide to their friends or fans for a fee, and give them meaning and value, such as authorized access to the issuer's individual intellectual property, privileged access to private real or virtual space, witnessing and commemorating certain events, etc. The value of the total number of credits issued by a user represents its credit value(if any), implying the widely recognized creditworthiness of that user in the community.

## Miraland Blockchain (MBC)

Miraland Blockchain runs on a number of nodes, all of which together represent the consensus of the community. Depending on the purpose of the setup, Miraland Blockchain classifies 3 types of networks: development network, test network and main network. The development network is used for the iteration of the community chain itself and ecological application development; the test network provides sufficient testing and verification for the constantly iterating Miraland Blockchain and the application services on it before it is put into operation on the main network; the main network is the real network carrier that carries the trust, consensus, value of the whole community and the transfer or flow of users' digital assets.

Based on the PoS protocol, Miraland is a flexible and scalable, stable, fast and secure distributed decentralized Lay-1 blockchain that largely bypasses the centralized link in other similar blockchain ecologies. The Miraland chain is derived from the Solana open source code baseline for the pan-industry public, and has undergone a deep transformation to fit the positioning and needs of the Crai Transformer X context, while adhering to its open source spirit, following the original license terms, modifying and removing the trademark property rights and its original crypto assets upstream of the software, and extending it to create the necessary resource plug-ins to meet the needs of numerous tribal and industrial applications.

Miraland (MLN) is the native token of the Miraland Blockchain.

Validator nodes are the key foundational elements of the Miraland blockchain, and they work together to form the backbone network. The validators of the Miraland chain handle the network transaction, witness and implement the consensus mechanism, thus realizing the tamper-proof, high-performance and trustless features of the Miraland chain as a community infrastructure in the Crai era.

The **Crai Transformer X** project encourages users/qthors to join the validation node program to create, build and govern together, and lay a rocky foundation for the community to operate.

Miraland Chain defends the sustainable development of the community, which protects the individual credit value of users!

## Miraland Cryptocar Inscription: MLNX
As an attempt to explore the symbiotic interconnection of the ecosphere, Qing Tong Horizon has deployed the community's BRC-20 inscription in the Bitcoin ecosystem: [mlnx](https://unisat.io/brc20/mlnx), which are used to map the future community Cryptocar virtual digital assets, providing a broader space for ecological innovation. The total supply of mlnx is 21 million, open and fair, and anyone can participate to inscribe and mint them.

## Future Outlook

Community digital assets are currently designed for carbon-based civilizations and belong to individual users, but the ultimate goal also includes silicon-based civilizations. Digital assets will eventually be designed and built for all intelligent species (whether carbon-based or silicon-based) and are natural and native credentials for exchanging trust and value between intelligent species. Initially, they must be piloted and circulated among individuals in the community under the regulation of a legal framework, in the medium term they will circulate between sovereign individuals and intelligent species, and in the long term they will be tokens of mutual exchange between intelligent species.
