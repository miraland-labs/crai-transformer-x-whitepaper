## Crai Transformer X (CATX)

Civilization has entered the era of Web 3.0 and AI. AI has greatly increased productivity, and Web 3.0 has naturally provided the accompanying production relations for this revolutionary productivity, which is also the basis of Web 3.0: crypto-rized decentralization. To more succinctly express this combination of revolutionary productivity and innovative production relations, we define a new term: Crai, which means the fusion of crypto and AI.

The automobile, and especially the current birth of the intelligent species represented by the smart car, is the frontier battleground where Crai can be integrated and concentrated. From smart driving or smart interaction, to the data generated and the value derived from it, to the sovereign ownership of various rights and interests, everything is connected and rooted in Crai! Crai transforms everything and this is how the Crai Transformer X project was born.

The Crai Transformer X project consists of two core components: an AI-enabled user-governed value community (Qing Tong Horizon) and a crypto-driven community chain that forms the underlying decentralized infrastructure, the Miraland blockchain. The former focuses on user interaction and user experience, while the latter focuses on providing fair and equal trust and value support.

## Qing Tong Horizon (QTH)

Any individual, company, or AI intelligence can choose to join Qing Tong Horizon as a member, and members are commonly referred to as Qthor(s). The core spirit of Qing Tong Horizon emphasizes user autonomy, user consensus, and user value. QTH consists of several tribes organized around industry topics or interests. QTH plans to introduce three categories of digital assets for airdrop, reward, award, or grant to community members:

1. Community native digital tokens that can be used to vote on the governance of the co-created community;
2. Community-derived digital tokens that represent the credit or value that users earn, accumulate, and use to exchange for products or services on a daily basis;
3. Community Digital Collections (NFT), a privilege and credential that can prove the user's identity and allow the user to participate in an activity or event, as well as one of the carriers of the user's collection or storage value.
   Digital assets include, but are not limited to: points, badges, in-game props, community rewards, user avatars, virtual cars, other digital rights and interests (such as vouchers), and even virtual shares worth trying and exploring (depending on the degree of legal and regulatory permission).
   The virtual car NFT attempted by the Crai Transformer X project is evolvable[1], and the growth of the virtual car depends on user behavior, data voluntarily or actively contributed by members, or vehicle data.

The community encourages user innovation and co-creation, and measures user innovation and contribution in the form of digital assets through community consensus, confirms rights, and users are free to dispose of data and virtual digital assets that belong to them.

Community members can issue their own credit tokens or NFTs to give or offer to their friends or fans for a fee, giving them meaning and value, such as authorized access to the issuer's personal intellectual property, access privileges to private virtual space, witnessing and commemorating certain events, etc.

## Miraland Blockchain (MBC)

Miraland Blockchain runs on a number of nodes, all of which together represent the consensus of the community. Depending on the purpose of the setup, Miraland Blockchain classifies 3 types of networks: development network, test network and main network. The development network is used for the iteration of the community chain itself and ecological application development; the test network provides sufficient testing and verification for the constantly iterating Miraland Blockchain and the application services on it before it is put into operation on the main network; the main network is the real network carrier that carries the trust, consensus, value of the whole community and the transfer or flow of users' digital assets.

Based on the PoS protocol, Miraland is a flexible and scalable, stable, fast and secure distributed decentralized Lay-1 blockchain that largely bypasses the centralized link in other similar blockchain ecologies. The Miraland chain is derived from the Solana open source code baseline for the pan-industry public, and has undergone a deep transformation to fit the positioning and needs of the Crai Transformer X context, while adhering to its open source spirit, following the original license terms, modifying and removing the trademark property rights and its original crypto assets upstream of the software, and extending it to create the necessary resource plug-ins to meet the needs of numerous tribal and industrial applications.

Miraland (MLN) is the native token of the Miraland Blockchain.

Validator nodes are the key foundational elements of the Miraland blockchain, and they work together to form the backbone network. The validators of the Miraland chain handle the network transaction, witness and implement the consensus mechanism, thus realizing the tamper-proof, high-performance and trustless features of the Miraland chain as a community infrastructure in the Crai era.

The **Crai Transformer X** project encourages users/qthors to join the validation node program to create, build and govern together, and lay a rocky foundation for the community to operate.

Miraland Chain defends the sustainable development of the community, which protects the individual credit value of users!
